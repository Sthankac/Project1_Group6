<h1 style="font-size:150%;">Health Insurance Policy for employees of a company</h1>
<p style="font-size:110%;"> Health insurance is one of the most desirable benefits you can offer employees.
 There are several basic options for setting up a plan.Once the company or organization had selected 
the insurance plan the employees had a chance to accept or decline it.
 Health insurance coverage may also be extended to the immediate family
 and/or other dependents of group members for an extra cost.
The cost of group health insurance is usually much lower than individual plans
 because the risk is spread across a higher number of people. Simply put, this
 type of insurance is cheaper and more affordable than individual plans
 available on the market because there are more people who buy into the plan.</p>
